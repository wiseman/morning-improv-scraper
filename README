In the old days Scott McCloud's Morning Improv blog
(http://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/mi/index.html) was updated by him
by hand-editing HTML.  This code scraped his blog and generated an RSS
feed.  That feed was then syndicated on Livejournal at
http://syndicated.livejournal.com/scottmccloud/

This code is no longer used since Scott moved to using real blogging
software instead of hand editing HTML.
