Morning Improv Blog Scraper
===========================

In the old days `Scott McCloud's Morning Improv blog` was updated by
him by hand-editing HTML.  This code scraped his blog and generated an
RSS feed.  That feed was then syndicated on Livejournal at
http://syndicated.livejournal.com/scottmccloud/

This code is no longer used since Scott moved to using real blogging
software instead of hand editing HTML.
